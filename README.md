# Generate Anni Albers style patterns

https://atomcorp.github.io/anni4/

This is a very much work a progress. The code is very "iterative" (ie. messy).

The point of this is I love the work of [Anni Albers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anni_Albers) and so for fun I'm trying to replicate the style of some of her works, but have them slightly randomised. There is a seed system so the generated patterns can be saved and shared.

The code is just plain TypeScript rendering to a HTML canvas, with the help from a couple of libraries for generating the seeds and webpack for dev/bundling.

Install with `yarn`, run dev with `yarn start`, compile website with `yarn build`
